## Image to onenote ink converter

This is a test repository for trying to create onenote cloud pages that contain handwriting.

At this time it appears the APIs Microsoft provides do not support this functionality.

This repo contains a few tests in the `test/` folder which allow you to test this api out and see it fail.

To get started:
1) npm install
2) npm install within the auth-app folder
3) read the README in the auth-app folder, and configure a test application with microsoft to get an app id / secret
4) run the `server.js` file in the auth-app folder to get an access token
4) `npm run test` and have fun with the tests in the `test` directory.

Cheers. I guess?
